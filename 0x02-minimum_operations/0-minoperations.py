'''
In a text file, there is a single character H. Your text editor can execute
only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number n, write
a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in
exactly n H characters in the file.

    Prototype: def minOperations(n)
    Returns an integer
    If n is impossible to achieve, return 0

Example:

n = 9

H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste =>HHH => Copy All =>
Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH

Number of operations: 6

def minOperations(n):
    '''
    Does as required above
    '''
    if n <= 1:
        return 0

    operation_count = 0
    divisor = 2

    while n > 1:
        while n % divisor == 0:
            operation_count += divisor
            n //= divisor
        divisor += 1

    return operation_count
